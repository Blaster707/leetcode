# LeetCode Exercises

This repo is where I created solution to different LeetCode exercises.  Starting with Easy problems and progressing into more 
challenging ones, I was able to build my skillset and practice data structures and algorithms.  This also allowed me to get
a good handle on the basic library for Kotlin, alongside utilizing Junit tests for practice and speedier confirmation of solutions.

I am especially pleased with the Ex036 Valid Sudoku solution.  This was one of the most challenging to write, but it allowed
me to practice refactoring using code smells.  I also was able to use classes and interfaces more effectively than in other solutions, 
and progressively developed what was once a confusing albeit functional solution into a cohesive, concise and clear solution.
